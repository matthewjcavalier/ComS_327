Spec Compliance:
    This program finds and prints solutions to the 8Queens
    probelm. The each solution is output in a single line in
    the specified format.

MakeRules:
    The first rule in the Makefile compiles the program for regular
    use as well as debugging. There is a rule called run that will
    compile the program, run it and redirect the output to a text
    file called output.txt

Functions:
    clearBoard: 
        puts zeros at evey index of the board

    invalid family of functions:
        check to see if the peice at a location on the board
        breaks a placement rule in the different directions from
        the peice
 
    isValidPlacement:
        checks that if a peice placed at the row col violates any
        placement rules

    printBoardString():
        prints the chessboard in string representation
    
    placePiece(int row):
        places tries to place a new peice in the specified row at
        all positions, only makeing a recursive call when the placement
        is valid

Files:
    Makefile: contains make rules

    changeLog.txt: contains the git log for the assignment

    queens.c: the c source file for the assignment

    output.txt: the file generated when calling "make run"

    queens: the binary program

    debug: the binary program with debug flags turned on
