Compliance:

  The current state of the program allows for a dungeon to be generated randomly. A minimum of 5
  rooms with each room being connected to a network of all of the rooms in the dungeon.

  Side Notes:

    The current release of the program comes with two more flags that can be set when the program
    is started:

      --save    saves the dungeon that is created to ~/.rlg327/dungeon (note this will fail
                if the directory ~/.rlg327 does not exist)
                
                  ex:
                        ./crawler --save

      --load    loads the dungeon from data stored in ~/.rlg327/dungeon (note this will fail
                if the file ~/.rlg327/dungeon does not exist)
                
                  ex:
                        ./crawler --load
