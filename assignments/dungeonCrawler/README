Compliance:

  This program currently will read in the number of monsters to place into
  the dungeon, and randomly place each one while also making each monster
  a set permutation of the four attributes requested. You can tell what
  kind each monster is as signified by it's character (hex range from 0 to F).

  Side Note:
    
    I still feel that the '-cool' way to run it is much more readable

  modifiers (See CMD_line_args.txt for other modifiers):
    
    --nummon    This command line arg followed by a value will set the
                number of monsters in the dungeon. For an easy win, set
                the number of monsters to zero.

                  example:
                    
                    ./crawler --nummon 5

Functions:

  monster_routine && nonEraticMovement (see crawler.c)

    These functions are where the logic for the monsters lives.

  moveRandomly (see crawler.c)

    This function moves a character (whether pc or npc) to a random spot around
    it, keeping in mind if the entity can tunnel or not.

  functions in lines 404 to 425 (see crawler.c)

    These functions could be used for telling attributes of the monsters.
    I ended up not using them, but want to include them for if they are
    needed in the future.
 
Data structures:

  Priority Queue:
    This data structure was implemented by making a min heap (see heap.c),
    this min heap is realized using an array to make the operations
    easier when adding, removing, searching, and bubbling up.

File Names:

  heap.c: the new file added that contains the logic for the min Heap data structure

  heap.h: the header file for heap.c
