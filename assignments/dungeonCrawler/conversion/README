Compliance:

    This final iteration of the dungeon project complies
    with the specification given. It includes the new 
    commands for the player to use (NOTE: the teleport
    command has had it's key changed over to the 'g' key
    for startup, still uses 't' and 'r' like before though
    when in the targeting mode). Also, comabat has been 
    updated so that characters don't die in one hit (unless
    one of them is really overpowered). Finally, the game 
    ends in a loss if the player is killed, and ends in a 
    win if the player kills a boss monster.
