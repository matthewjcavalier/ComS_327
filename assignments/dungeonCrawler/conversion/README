Compliance:

  This assignment meets the doc specification in that the fog of war feature has
  been implemented, the teleportation debugging features have been implemented,
  and the 'show whole dungeon' debugging feature has been implemented. Since I
  had a lot of time on my hands, instead of just converting the codebase to c++,
  I did a ground-up rewrite of the project in c++.

Functions:
  
  PC::drawDunMap    (see Character.cpp)
    
      This method is how the PC displays it's personal dungeon map

  PC::updateDunMap  (see Character.cpp)
  
      This method updates the PC's personal dungeon map taking into
      account how far the PC can see and if the PC has direct line of sight
      to each tile being saved.
 
Data structures:
  
  priority_queue    (see game.cpp)
    
      I ended up replacing my custom priority queue implementation with the one provided by c++

File Names:
  
  Character.cpp   The soucre file that has the character class and it's sub classes

  Character.h     The header file for Character.cpp
  
  defs.h          A general header that defines multiple constants as well as a coordinate data structure

  dungeon.cpp     The source file that has the dungeon, tile, and room classes

  dungeon.h       The header file for dungeon.cpp

  game.cpp        The source file that drives the main game loop

  game.h          The header file for game.cpp

  screen.cpp      The source file that does most of the ncurses stuff for drawing to screen

  screen.h        The header file for screen.h
