Command Line arguments:

      -s      This flag followed by any number or string will be used as the seed for 
              generating the dungeon.

              		example:
                
                  		./crawler -s 1234556

      -cool   This flag makes the program use unicode characters to display the dungeon
              in a different fashion than normal

              		example:
                  
                  		./crawler -cool
                  
      --save  saves the dungeon that is created to ~/.rlg327/dungeon (note this will fail
              if the directory ~/.rlg327 does not exist)
                
                  	example:
                        ./crawler --save

      --load  loads the dungeon from data stored in ~/.rlg327/dungeon (note this will fail
              if the file ~/.rlg327/dungeon does not exist)
                
                  	example:
                        ./crawler --load
          
      --nummon    This command line arg followed by a value will set the number of monsters
      			  in the dungeon. For an easy win, set the number of monsters to zero.

                  	example:
                    
                    	./crawler --nummon 5
